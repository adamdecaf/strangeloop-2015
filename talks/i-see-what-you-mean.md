# I See What You Mean

By Peter Alvaro

## Beliefs

- Abstraction is sometimes harmful
 - They easily allow false beliefs to either be ignored or leak through

## Model theoretic languages

- SQL hides all behaviour and returns models
- Web servers can be viewed as a join between static content and a stream of requests
- Datalog allows for expressing selection, filtering, and composition with the added "least fixed point" operator
  - Also allows actual execution to happen in any order

## Dedalus

- Knowledge is ephermeral
- Knowledge is relative
- It only makes sense on one node at a given time on that node
- State is induction in time
- Evolved into a language called [bloom](http://www.bloom-lang.net/), then build [Blazes](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~palvaro/ICDE14_conf_full_205.pdf), then a project at Netflix
  - [eve]() a programming environment for non programmers

## Why invent languages?

- Respect your users, they're using your abstractions
- Meaning well > feels good
